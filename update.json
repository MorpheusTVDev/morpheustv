Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation. Was is found in a preserve? A public park? An urban or suburban setting? Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

of Texas","description":"The purpose of this project is to broaden the understanding of Texas plant communities - both native and non-native - and contribute to knowledge of their diversity and range. It is hoped that the observations within this project will lead to a greater appreciation of the botanical Texas, while also helping guide resources toward conservation efforts.   \r\n\r\nWhile this project was started by a citizen scientist and Texas Master Naturalist as a hobby project, we encourage the use of the project and data by research and conservation professionals working in all areas of Texas botany. Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation. Was is found in a preserve? A public park? An urban or suburban setting? Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.

Is it in an area in danger of development? â€“ any information that may help inform understanding of the plant or its habitat.

Also, observations of Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) may be invited to other appropriate projects, such as the TPWD-curated project, Texas Botanical Treasures at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/texas-botanical-treasures  so that conservation planning and resources can be directed at the plant community as needed. \r\n\r\nAs such, we need accurate location data, good photos, and - hopefully - some textual description of the habitat within which  you made your observation.
